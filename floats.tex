\item[\DOT] BINARY DATA WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE DECIMAL PARTS
\item[\DOT] YEARS OF COMPILER DEVELOPMENT yet NO REAL-WORLD USE FOUND for anything other than \texttt{char} and \texttt{int}
\item[\DOT] Wanted to use decimal numbers anyway for a laugh? We had a tool for that: It was called FIXED-POINT ARITHMETIC
\item[\DOT] ‘\texttt{x==x} can be FALSE’, ‘$\frac1 0$ is a number’, ‘the sum of $\frac1{10}$
and $\frac2{10}$ is\\$0.30000000004$’—statements dreamt up by the utterly Deranged
\end{itemize}

\noindent
LOOK at what Floating-Point Numbers have been demanding your Respect for all this time,
with all the circuits and data types we built for them\\
\textbf{(This is REAL Floating-Point Arithmetic, done by REAL computers)}:\medskip

‘Sure, that’ll be \texttt{f!=f?0:-1/0.f==f||f==-1.f/0?0:-1.f>f}’\medskip
